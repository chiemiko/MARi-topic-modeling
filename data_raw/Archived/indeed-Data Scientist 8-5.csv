Memorial Sloan Kettering,"New York, NY 10017",Sr Strategic Consultant / Data Scientist (Patient Access) ,16,," 
 <h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Company Overview
At Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK), we’re not only changing the way we treat cancer, but also the way the world thinks about it. By working together and pushing forward with innovation and discovery, we’re driving excellence and improving outcomes.<br/>
<br/>
For the 28th year, MSK has been named a top hospital for cancer by U.S. News &amp; World Report. We are proud to be on Becker’s Healthcare list as one of the 150 Great Places to Work in Healthcare in 2018, as well as one of Glassdoor’s Employees’ Choice Best Place to Work for 2018. We’re treating cancer, one patient at a time. Join us and make a difference every day.<br/>

<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Job Description
WHEN APPLYING: Please include (as a single PDF) both a resume and a cover letter; in the letter, we’d love to hear about the most impactful project you’ve worked on recently.<br/>

Strategy Analytics and Patient Access
The Strategy Analytics team (within the Department of Strategy &amp; Innovation) leverages data to shape strategic decisions at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and solve problems that measurably impact the lives of our patients and staff. We were awarded the 2012 INFORMS Prize for “repeatedly applying the principles of advanced analytics and operations research / management science in pioneering, varied, novel, and lasting ways.” We encourage analysts’ technical and business skill development in a variety of ways, including conferences and external workshops, internal training and journal clubs, creating analytical tools and best practices, and developing our own in-house R package.<br/>

This position is part of the Embedded Analytics Program and has dual reporting to (1) the Senior Director of Patient Access for goal setting and project implementation and (2) the Analytics Manager for technical supervision and mentorship. Embedded Analytics allows our analysts to be a full member of an operational team to truly understand their needs and ensure sustainable implementation of work, while still being part of a diverse and energizing community of analytics experts.<br/>
The Patient Access Service (PAS) is the front-door for the majority of Memorial Sloan Kettering’s patients. A team of 70+ Care Advisors and nurses is charged with helping patients access MSK clinicians by collecting information about their medical history and treatments, identifying the right sub-specialist to provide expert care, and coordinating appointment logistics.<br/>

The Role and Projects
We are seeking a Senior Strategic Consultant / Data Scientist who will serve as the lead on projects crucial to ensuring MSK’s growth and allowing patients continued access to our clinicians’ expertise. This will involve defining and scoping analyses, collecting and managing data, performing statistical and mathematical modeling, developing new tools and systems, and disseminating actionable insights. This will be as part of a team of two, in partnership with the current Data Scientist embedded with the Patient Access Service.<br/>

You will:
Serve as an analytical thought partner to Patient Access leadership, especially the Senior Director, Clinical Director, and 8 front-line managers
Become deeply versed in the operational needs of Patient Access and own the strategic roadmap for iteratively developing analytical products in support of those needs
Manage individual analytical products and projects (both independently and in collaboration with the current Data Scientist) from ""question to answer"" including problem framing, data collection and validation, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, visualization, synthesis, and ongoing maintenance of reusable tools
Effectively communicate actionable insights and see them through to implementation<br/>

Sample projects include:
Growth Planning and Strategy: PAS leadership collaborates closely with clinicians and administrators on how to grow and manage their services. How can we provide them additional data and insights to guide clinician recruitment and practice management?
Call Center Operations: Patient demand is variable and changing. How can we define optimal staffing and training policies so as to maximize service levels while maintaining staff satisfaction?
Patient Experience: How can we collect timely and relevant data about patients’ experience of becoming an MSK patient while being respectful of their time and emotional state? How can we surface insights from this data to improve PAS operations?<br/>

Qualifications
We are looking for an analytics professional who has both deep technical skills and a passion for applying them to real-world problems in partnership with non-technical stakeholders. Our successful analysts typically have the below qualifications:<br/>

You have a proven track record (4-7 years of experience) of using analytics and data science to impact key business decisions
You’re a strong consultant skilled at partnering with non-technical stakeholders to turn vague business problems into crisp analytical projects
You know how to choose the right technical approach for a question (from a statistical model to a dashboard and everything in between) and know that the simplest solution is often the best
You’re a storyteller, able to synthesize knowledge from a variety of sources and clearly communicate complex topics to non-technical audiences<br/>

You’ve conducted reproducible analyses using R, Python, or a similar language
You’ve built beautiful production-grade dashboards using Tableau or a similar BI tool
You’re deeply comfortable with relational databases and SQL
You have a solid understanding of common statistical methods (especially regression models and probability)<br/>

You’re curious and self-motivated, and you thrive when working autonomously. You know when to run with something and when to ask for help.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g. statistics, economics, operations research, mathematics) or equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience<br/>

Nice-to-have qualifications (but definitely not requirements) would include a master’s degree and prior experience in healthcare or call center operations.<br/>

We do that by working with some complex clients on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and keeping our skills sharp. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like so hang out with. That's important.<br/>

And… Why We’re Both Here - This “Job” Thing
Here it is: we have some opportunities. And we’d like to get to know some more amazing people, that might want to talk about that. People like you. Since you’re reading this, and the title’s “data scientist,” we’re thinking you might be a little interested. Very cool.<br/>

We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. We've got some tricky time-series data on this particular project and are looking for creative minds in the deep learning space to tackle it. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).

Who You Are
Okay, beyond the basics (you solve problems, and are generally nice), we’re looking for a few skills. Less concerned with the specific technologies (great scientists can learn new tech as it emerges), more about horsepower.. That said, here are a couple bullets, things we look for:<br/>

Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data (time-series a plus!).
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
You've got experience with deep learning.
Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.
Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time-series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics.
We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem sets<br/>

Required:
Secret clearance required, higher is a plus
Bachelor's degree in a technical field<br/>

Twitter,"New York, NY",Machine Learning Engineer ,2,," 
  
 Are you an engineer who’s interested in tackling very challenging adversarial problems and passionate about defending online users against abuse, spam, and manipulation? Do you love working on challenging problems that require a multi-disciplinary approach, creative solutions, and rapid product iterations? Will you be proud to work on a real-time, scalable system that serves millions of users daily? If so, you should join us.

Who We Are

The Health ML engineering team is responsible for building scalable detection systems that keep spam, manipulation, and abuse at bay. We use ML and relevance techniques to make Twitter safer and to limit the spread of misinformation on the platform. Our team works across the product to detect abusive and spammy users and content, increase action on bad actors, drive changes in user behavior, and detect and remediate accounts that are violating the terms of service on Twitter.

We develop, maintain, and contribute to several machine learning models and systems, including:

Models that detect unwanted interactions
Models to prioritize human review of accounts violating Twitter's policies to more quickly take action and limit their damage
Detection of bots that misuse the platform or spread misinformation
Detection of repeat abusive offenders who create new accounts after being suspended
Real-time rule engines and clustering systems to identify and action on clusters of bad actors at scale
What You’ll Do

Although you will work on cutting-edge problems, this position is not a pure research position. You will participate in the engineering life-cycle at Twitter, including designing distributed systems, writing production code and data pipelines, conducting code reviews and working alongside our infrastructure and reliability teams. You’ll apply data science, machine learning, and/or graph analysis techniques to a variety of modeling and relevance problems involving users, their social graph, their tweets, and their behavior.

Who You Are

You’re a relevance engineer, applied data scientist, or machine-learning engineer who wants to work on exciting algorithmic and deep infrastructure issues to improve the health of the public conversation on Twitter. You’re experienced at solving large scale relevance problems and comfortable doing incremental quality work while building brand new systems to enable future improvements.

You are knowledgeable in one or more of the following: machine learning (including deep learning), information retrieval, recommendation systems, social network analysis.
You are a strong technical advocate with a background in Java, C++, or Scala, and Python.
You strive to find the right balance between moving fast to deliver quality improvements to users and accumulating technical debt that drags down productivity.
You have a collaborative working style with a strong focus on disciplined execution and results.
You like to ground decisions in data and reasoning and solve root causes of problems rather than surface issues.
You are adept at communicating relevant information clearly and concisely.
You look ahead to identify opportunities and thrive in a culture of innovation.<br/>


Here’s all the legal good stuff:

We are committed to an inclusive and diverse Twitter. Twitter is an equal opportunity employer.

NT Concepts,United States,"Data Scientist (Ft. Worth, TX) ",30+,," 
 <h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Overview
Who We Are
We’re NT Concepts, a leading provider of business and technology solutions for the intelligence and national security communities! Our team of engineers, subject matter experts, and data scientists provide experienced, high-quality Information Technology (IT) and cybersecurity engineering and innovation support. We do that by working with some complex clients on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and keeping our skills sharp. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like so hang out with. That's important.<br/>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Responsibilities
And… Why We’re Both Here - This “Job” Thing
Here it is: we have some opportunities. And we’d like to get to know some more amazing people, that might want to talk about that. People like you. Since you’re reading this, and the title’s “data scientist,” we’re thinking you might be a little interested. Very cool.<br/>

We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. We've got some tricky time-series data on this particular project and are looking for creative minds in the deep learning space to tackle it. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Qualifications
Who You Are
Okay, beyond the basics (you solve problems, and are generally nice), we’re looking for a few skills. Less concerned with the specific technologies (great scientists can learn new tech as it emerges), more about horsepower.. That said, here are a couple bullets, things we look for:<br/>

Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data (time-series a plus!).
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
You've got experience with deep learning.
Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.
Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time-series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics.
We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem sets<br/>

Required:
Secret clearance required, higher is a plus
Bachelor's degree in a technical field<br/>

Here, you will be developing in a microservice architecture, where you will build REST APIs given solid requirements and using best practices. You especially love that we have unit tests and code coverage reports and feel strongly about keeping the code well-tested for easy, continuous releases with less than 5% bugs. Also, you feel right at home in a Unix-like environment, and may have experience with DevOps and/or SRE-related tasks, such as configuring builds and deployments using tools like Jenkins, AWS and Ansible.  
 
Billups staff work closely between product, UX, research sciences, software development, and infrastructure teams. We are highly skilled and collaborative, working to deliver innovative solutions to our business teams. This includes new services & features in modern apps. Our technical stack is state-of-the-art and is a joy for developers to work in. We practice lean & agile development, pair programming, UX prototyping, test-driven CI, and pull request code reviews (ticket tracking, acceptance testing, etc.) to produce high-quality code and continue to learn and improve the system. Billups has a developer community that thrives on solving challenging problems with and learning from experienced developers on data-driven systems.  
Billups has built the largest out-of-home (OOH) advertising platform in terms of transactions and users. We have patent-pending technology for helping advertisers plan the right media and locations for the most effective impact discover how their ad spend impacts audience behavior.

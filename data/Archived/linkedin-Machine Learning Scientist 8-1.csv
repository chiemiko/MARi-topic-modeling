Blue River Technology is building the next generation of smart agriculture equipment. We're introducing See & Spray technology, enabling a world in which every plant counts. Using computer vision and artificial intelligence, our smart machines can detect, identify, and make management decisions about every single plant in the field. These machines help farmers to improve profitability, protects the environment by reducing pesticide use by 90%, and captures valuable plant-by-plant data.Acquired by John Deere in 2017 Blue River Technology as an independently-run subsidiary. Through our partnership with Deere, Blue River has expanded rapidly and together both companies see many opportunities to apply advanced computer vision, machine learning, and robotics technologies to other areas in agriculture beyond spraying. Based in Sunnyvale, CA Blue River Technology is at the heart of Silicon Valley. Our team members make up a diverse environment of folks who share the same passion for computer vision, machine learning, systems software, autonomous vehicles and precision agriculture. Our working environment is fast paced and highly collaborative, and employees are excited to use their talents to improve food production and protect the environment.

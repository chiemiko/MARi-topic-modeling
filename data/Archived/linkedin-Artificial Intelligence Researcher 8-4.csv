News and social media move financial markets. Bloomberg is one of the largest producers of news in the world and we ingest millions of news stories every day from over 70,000 external news feeds and social media such as Twitter. This data keeps our clients informed, and our team's insights help make sense of it for our customers. 
Who are we? Bloomberg's Artificial Intelligence (AI) group: researchers and engineers who have a passion for solving complex problems. Our charter: to extract and identify relevant, meaningful, tradable, and actionable information (such as pricings, earnings, recommendations and major events) from data (including news, web, social media, and structured data) in real-time. Since our customers rely on this information to make swift financial decisions, we guarantee precision, accuracy, and latency numbers beyond most academic and industry standards. 
We aren't just building customer-facing products, as the infrastructure and algorithms we develop are themselves used across the company. We also publish papers, attend conferences, organize workshops, and contribute back to the larger data science community whenever we can (seehttps://www.techatbloomberg.com/nlp/ andhttps://bloomberg.com/company/d4gx/). 
Who are you? A research scientist and engineer who wants to work in the areas of machine learning, natural language processing, information extraction, reinforcement learning, graphical models, recommender systems, and/or knowledge graphs. You want to join a close-knit group and make a big impact.

Senior AI Scientist (Location: Lower Manhattan) 
  
About You  
Responsibilities: 
 
About Us 
We believe that the way humans conduct analytical work will undergo radical transformation over the next several years. Due to an explosion in digital information and cognitive limitations of the human brain, it is impossible for human analysts to capture the true complexity associated with forecasting future events using pre-defined factors. As such, we specialize in building dynamic, continuously learning models that automate complex cognitive tasks typically performed by human analysts. Our mission at Accrete.AI is to scale human expertise and compound the world's knowledge for the purpose of making accurate predictions about the real world that impact financial markets. 
  
We accomplish this by leveraging domain experts to create semantically rich training data on the order of less than 1% of the data from which our models continuously learn. As a result, we are able to produce a non-linear return on the cognitive effort expended by domain experts. Our dynamic continuously learning models, activated by proprietary mathematical functions, underlie an AI platform with a variety of core capabilities including intelligent web crawling, contextual analytics and semantic search. Leveraging these core capabilities, we build smart analytical tools that continuously read, understand and learn in specialized ways. As our smart analytical tools learn, they extract hidden features buried in complexity that surface predictive insights that would be impossible to find using traditional intelligence and tools. 
 
Our products are helping customers generate alpha by identifying and ranking sources most likely to publish reliable, market moving M&A rumors; monitor important shifts in topical nuance based on the interplay between management commentary and analyst questions in earnings transcripts; and monitor patient chatter on the efficacy and safety of clinical drug trials.  
 
Based in Lower Manhattan, Accrete has a majority interest in NYC based Shinrai, an AI Services subsidiary.

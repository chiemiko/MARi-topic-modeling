BACKGROUND  
On January 1, 2018, the Economics, Finance and Institutions (EFI) Vice Presidency created the Macroeconomics, Trade and Investment (MTI) Global Practice. The MTI Global Practice is responsible for delivering analytic, advisory, financial and convening services in the areas of fiscal management, macroeconomics, growth, trade policy, regional integration, business regulation, and investment climate.  These services support various lines of work with our clients including: (i) the design and implementation of macro-fiscal frameworks that are aligned with the goals of reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, and grounded in economic, social and environmental sustainability; (ii) the design and implementation of sustainable fiscal and debt policy, including on the effectiveness, efficiency, level and composition of government spending; (iii) growth analytics and policies to start, sustain and boost growth; and (iv) the analysis of the impact of external shocks and developments on growth and the government fiscal position, including, for example, terms of trade, global crisis and longer term issues such as population ageing. In addition, the MTI Global Practice is an important contributor to the integration of policies for growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity.  
  
Trade is an engine of growth that creates jobs, reduces poverty and increases economic opportunity. Regional integration helps countries overcome divisions that impede the flow of goods, services, capital, people and ideas. The World Bank Group helps its client countries improve their access to developed country markets and enhance their participation in the world economy and promote regional integration through common physical and institutional infrastructure. The Global Trade and Regional Integration Unit (GMTRI) performs analytical work to inform the design of policies and institutions, provides technical assistance and advisory services to strengthen governments’ capacity to reap the gains from trade and integration, finances investment in infrastructure and institutions for regional integration, and catalyzes domestic and international dialogue.

The work program’s development objective is to inform World Bank clients about the ex-ante effects of changes in trade policy on macroeconomic aggregates and localized micro distributional effects. The program relies heavily on the use of computable general-equilibrium (CGE) models linked to micro-based household surveys. It is expected that you will be well-versed in performing advanced data management and familiar with trade policy modeling based on global computable general equilibrium models and microsimulations.You will contribute extensively to the development and the use of the CGE (LINKAGE, ENVISGAE) and microsimulations (distributional) module of the modeling framework. The type of trade policies for investigation include distributional impacts as well as the localized labor market effects of new FTAs such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Africa Continental Free-Trade Agreement, as well as the analysis of linkages between trade, sector of employment, gender and poverty feeding among others to the Trade and Gender report. Experience with programming in GAMS is required, while STATA is considered a strong asset. You will also work on the preparation of outputs and contribute to research on trade, gender, and poverty including co-authoring reports and research papers.The specific tasks will include but are not limited to: •Operate CGE models such as the GTAP and the LINKAGE models•Perform model expansions of models based in GAMS.•Lead and update the CGE macro-micro framework, including model extensions and documentation•Generate simulations of policy scenarios and analysis/interpretation of the results•Contribute to the development of the unit’s knowledge products, such as policy research working papers, reports, and policy briefs•Contribute to dissemination of results within the World Bank outlets•Present the results to the Clients in an accessible way focusing on intuition behind the results and policy recommendations

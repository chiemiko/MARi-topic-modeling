Who We Are
We’re NT Concepts, a leading provider of business and technology solutions for the intelligence and national security communities! Our team of engineers, subject matter experts, and data scientists provide experienced, high-quality Information Technology (IT) and cybersecurity engineering and innovation support. We do that by working with some complex clients on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and keeping our skills sharp. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like so hang out with. That's important.<br/>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Responsibilities
And… Why We’re Both Here - This “Job” Thing
Here it is: we have some opportunities. And we’d like to get to know some more amazing people, that might want to talk about that. People like you. Since you’re reading this, and the title’s “data scientist,” we’re thinking you might be a little interested. Very cool.<br/>

We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. We've got some tricky time-series data on this particular project and are looking for creative minds in the deep learning space to tackle it. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Qualifications
Who You Are
Okay, beyond the basics (you solve problems, and are generally nice), we’re looking for a few skills. Less concerned with the specific technologies (great scientists can learn new tech as it emerges), more about horsepower.. That said, here are a couple bullets, things we look for:<br/>

Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data (time-series a plus!).
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
You've got experience with deep learning.
Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.
Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time-series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics.
We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem sets<br/>

Required:
Secret clearance required, higher is a plus
Bachelor's degree in a technical field<br/>

Who We Are
We’re NT Concepts, a leading provider of business and technology solutions for the intelligence and national security communities! Our team of engineers, subject matter experts, and data scientists provide experienced, high-quality Information Technology (IT) and cybersecurity engineering and innovation support. We do that by working with some complex clients on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and keeping our skills sharp. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like so hang out with. That's important.<br/>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Responsibilities
And… Why We’re Both Here - This “Job” Thing
Here it is: we have some opportunities. And we’d like to get to know some more amazing people, that might want to talk about that. People like you. Since you’re reading this, and the title’s “data scientist,” we’re thinking you might be a little interested. Very cool.<br/>

We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. We've got some tricky time-series data on this particular project and are looking for creative minds in the deep learning space to tackle it. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Qualifications
Who You Are
Okay, beyond the basics (you solve problems, and are generally nice), we’re looking for a few skills. Less concerned with the specific technologies (great scientists can learn new tech as it emerges), more about horsepower.. That said, here are a couple bullets, things we look for:<br/>

Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data (time-series a plus!).
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
You've got experience with deep learning.
Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.
Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time-series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics.
We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem sets<br/>

Booz Allen Hamilton,"Honolulu, HI 96813",Data Scientist ,30+,," 
 The Challenge:
Are you excited at the prospect of unlocking the secrets held by a data set? Are you fascinated by the possibilities presented by the IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence advances? In an increasingly connected world, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data open up new opportunities. As a data scientist, you can turn these complex data sets into useful information to solve global challenges. Across private and public sectors — from fraud detection, to cancer research, to national intelligence — you know the answers are in the data.
We have an opportunity for you to use your analytical skills to improve the DoD. You’ll work closely with your customer to understand their questions and needs, then dig into their data-rich environment to find the pieces of their information puzzle. You’ll develop algorithms, write scripts, build predictive analytics, use automation, apply machine learning, and use the right combination of tools and frameworks to turn that set of disparate data points into objective answers to help our military make informed decisions. You’ll provide your customer with a deep understanding of their data, what it all means, and how they can use it. Join us as we use data science for good in the DoD.
Empower change with us.

Booz Allen Hamilton,"Honolulu, HI 96813",Data Science Machine Learning Lead ,30+,," 
 The Challenge:
As large amounts of data are collected from diverse sources, such as social media, images, video, and sensor feeds, extracting patterns and drawing relationships across them can be challenging. You, however, know how to analyze these types of data, allowing analysts to draw conclusions from the patterns in the data and to ask hard questions, which previously there would have been no hope of answering. We’re looking for you, a data scientist, machine learning engineer, or artificial intelligence specialist who knows how to step back and understand the complex relationships between the business needs, the data, and modeling approaches.
On our team, you’ll have the opportunity to accelerate innovation in artificial intelligence by working with the military to develop innovative solutions that harness the best technologies to process vast amounts of data, for critical mission systems and decision making. You will apply knowledge of your particular field of specialization towards the assessment of program concepts, research and development activities, or emerging technologies. As a machine learning engineer, leadership and clients will look to your guidance to help them evaluate technical progress, identify risks, and recommend mitigation activities.
Empower change with us.

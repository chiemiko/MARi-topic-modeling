About Us: 
﻿ 
Better Place Forests is completely redesigning the end-of-life experience, bringing fresh thinking and a much-needed focus on customer experience to the staid, fragmented and unfriendly end-of-life industry. We're building America's first conservation spreading forests for families and individuals who choose cremation, offering a sustainable alternative to costly traditional burial while tackling a market opportunity >$600B in the U.S. alone.  
 
80% of the 75M baby boomers in the U.S. are choosing cremation but do not have a beautiful, private and permanently-protected place to return their ashes to the earth. Instead of graves and tombstones, Better Place Forests incorporates ashes into the base of beautiful trees in the most iconic locations in North America. Every customer who chooses a tree helps to protect and preserve that forest forever. Through our Impact Tree program, we also plant additional trees to help with reforestation efforts. 
 
With thousands of customers and rapid growth, Better Place Forests is creating a movement that is removing the stigma around end-of-life planning. We're backed by the investors behind Tesla, Peloton, SpaceX and Blue Bottle and we've received national coverage in publications such as The New York Times, Fast Company and Business Insider. To learn more about Better Place Forests, visit www.betterplaceforests.com. 
 
""In a time when conservation is becoming increasingly urgent, it's rather poetic to protect a tree with your remains, secure in the knowledge that more are being planted in your honor."" - Fast Company 
 
""Tree burial is good for the environment, the location is more beautiful than a traditional graveyard — and it's cheaper as well."" - The New York Times 
 
The role: 
 
As the Data Analyst, you will work directly with the Head of Strategy and Operations to organize, explore, analyze and visualize the company's data. Your role is quintessentially cross-functional, requiring collaboration with all departments (marketing, sales, product & engineering, customer support, operations, finance and real estate) to understand analytics needs, prioritize competing requests, and deliver data-driven insights. Your core responsibility will be to use data to empower everyone in the company, from frontline employees to the CEO, to do their jobs better. 
 
The first priority will be to ensure there is appropriate visibility and alignment across the organization on our descriptive analytics. This includes ensuring data integrity and building dashboards that show outcomes and performance across the business. 
 
Soon after, the priority will be bringing excellence to our diagnostic analytics. This will require developing a deep understanding of the sales and marketing funnel, customer journey, and the underlying drivers of our business, and then applying that understanding to analyze our data and create visualizations that enable the organization to know the why behind the performance. 
 
Next, we will ask you to play a leading role in developing the company’s predictive analytics capabilities. This is a new initiative for the company which will enable us to reliably anticipate future outcomes and therefore develop more informed business plans and strategies. 
 
Ultimately, once we have developed the source of truth for where we are and where we are headed, we will ask you to explore what’s possible with prescriptive analytics, proactively providing recommended actions to teams and leaders across the company. 
 
As the depth of analysis and insights increases, so too will the volume and complexity of our operations, products, and data. You’ll need to work closely with leaders of the company to develop a data model that accurately reflects the current state of the business and can flexibly scale with the business. You’ll also need to work closely with engineering to ensure we have data architecture in place that supports reliable, real-time analysis and puts clean data in the hands of non-analysts. 
 
Responsibilities: 
 
 
Preferred Qualifications: 
 
 
How to reach us: 
 
Overall, our work environment is highly collaborative and transparent - we believe in centralized data and decentralized decision making. We maintain high standards for our own and each other's work and are all deeply committed to the mission - while having fun in the process.

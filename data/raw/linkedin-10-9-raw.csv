Benchling's mission is to accelerate the research that propels us towards this future, and magnify its impact, through modern software.Every day, scientists around the world use Benchling in their efforts to solve humanity's most pressing problems. For these scientists, Benchling is the central technology they use to conduct their research.Benchling was founded by a team of MIT graduates and has raised funding from Benchmark, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and Y Combinator. Our customers include pharmaceutical giants, leading biotechs, and the world's most renowned research institutes.We're looking for interns to join our Summer 2021 intern class. As an intern, you'll be entrusted with a significant degree of ownership to work alongside full-time engineers who hail from MIT, Google, Facebook, Stripe, and more. Our past interns have built DNA search engines, key pieces of AWS infrastructure, and analytics pipelines. You'll learn how a startup works and how to build high quality software, quickly.Responsibilities Work with and learn from a strong team of engineers hailing from MIT, CMU, Facebook, Stripe, and more. We grow our interns through mentorship and ownership. Own projects end-to-end, from initial design, to prototype, to large-scale rollout.

Enjoy ownership and building key pieces of product. Are interested in learning more about life science (prior knowledge is not required; desire to learn is a must). YOU MIGHT WORK ONCheck out our blog post for some examples of past intern work. Here are some other examples of recent and future projects: Tools to simulate DNA assembly - computers can assist scientists by informing scientific decisions with complex calculations. Our bulk assembly tool allows scientists to simulate constructing hundreds of DNA constructs in parallel, visualizing the end result and highlighting potential issues. Complex querying and visualization tools - The big advantage of keeping all your data stored in one system is that you can query that data all at once, without digging up multiple sources. This works best when you can query Benchling the same way you can query a database: by choosing from a large number of possible filters on any related objects, joining together various sources, and performing aggregations. We want to enable this in a user-friendly experience, without leaving your browser. A customizable computation platform - Biologics are typically large protein complexes composed of a number of shared parts. We want to let scientists specify computations that can aggregate data across all of these related entities to surface derived values, which can be used in everything from data analysis to naming schemes. Scientists may develop custom protein analysis algorithms or proprietary validation logic - they'll be able to hook in custom code and push that computation to Benchling. Data warehouse as a product - customers can click a button and spin up a fully-managed, query-able warehouse with all their Benchling data in one place. Customers get the full power of Redshift/Postgres without having to manage ETL pipelines or tune Postgres configuration values. A new permissions system - Our existing permission system relies on Read/Write/Admin access that can only be applied at the top level of the file hierarchy. To roll out to enterprises with 500+ users, we need to offer them fine-grained control around exactly what actions a user can take and let them manage these in a hierarchical fashion. OUR VALUES Empower through information. We explain the ""why"" behind every decision, unless there are highly sensitive circumstances. We're honest about how we're doing, especially in difficult times. We believe that sharing information builds trust and enables better decision-making. Rely on tenacity. Hard work is one of the greatest factors to determine success and is fully under our control. We must make the most of every day by bringing the highest level of determination. Dreaming big is not enough. Raise the bar. Pushing ourselves and others to improve will be uncomfortable and at times result in failure. However, it's critical to our success. We're dedicated to creating a place where everyone feels challenged to improve. Build a lever. We choose to build tools and infrastructure that will help others make world-changing innovations. There's less glory in it, but in the words of Archimedes, ""Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.""

From our inception, we have engaged in advocacy at a global level that aims to transform the human rights landscape for refugees in first countries of refuge. Our initial advocacy targeted problems in UN-run refugee status determination proceedings that decide the fate of nearly 100,000 refugees in more than 50 countries worldwide, drawing on the direct, on-the-ground experience of our founding staff and board members who had provided legal assistance to refugees navigating these proceedings in Egypt, Uganda, Turkey, Ecuador and elsewhere.We launched our first overseas pilot project - a Community Legal Empowerment initiative that trained refugees to provide basic legal advice and advocacy within their own communities - in January 2007 in partnership with the University of Capetown’s refugee legal aid clinic in Capetown, South Africa. In October 2007, we opened our doors in Quito, Ecuador and Bangkok, Thailand.In 2009, we began work in the refugee camps in the Western Tanzania region of Kigoma, and then in June 2010 we moved our Tanzania operations to Dar Es Salaam. In 2011 we achieved our target number for full capacity across these three offices - 5,000 refugees receiving legal information, advice, and/or representation annually - and began planning for expansion to other countries where refugees are denied their fundamental human rights.Position DescriptionAsylum Access is committed to building a global refugee work rights movement beyond countries where we have offices.

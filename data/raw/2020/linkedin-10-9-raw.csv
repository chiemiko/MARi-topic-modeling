GFW is now developing new models, both on these GPS positions and on satellite imagery, to fully reveal activity in the world's oceans. These models include object detection from global feeds of satellite radar and optical imagery, and models that infer, based on vessel behavior, illegal activity and unreported catch. We believe that these new models have the potential to dramatically change the way we monitor and manage the world's oceans.The PositionForced labor in fisheries is increasingly recognized as a human rights crisis. Until recently, its extent was poorly understood and no tools existed for systematically detecting forced labor risk on individual fishing vessels on a global scale. Working closely with the GFW technical teams and GFW's research partners, the data scientist will refine our current vessel-level behavioral model to predict fishing vessels that have a higher risk of using forced labor and will develop new models. The position represents an exciting opportunity to apply modern ML to big data problems in a field where it has been little used to date. Unlike traditional supervised learning this problem is an example of ""positive-unlabeled (PU)"" learning (because we don't know which vessels do not use forced labor), requiring less straightforward approaches and presenting interesting challenges. The existing model has been applied to a small training set, and working with global partners we are currently identifying additional labeled data. The successful candidate will refine the models as new data are acquired and subsequent model predictions will be tested in the field through our network of partners.Skilled use of R or Python (current model is implemented in R) is needed, as is some experience with SQL and knowledge of machine learning techniques. A successful candidate does not need to demonstrate all of the skills required for this job, but does have to show an aptitude for learning such skills on the job. We have many successful data scientists who started with limited modeling experience. The ideal candidate will be excited about working with global data and will have a high aptitude for learning new techniques. Global Fishing Watch values working quickly, innovating, and working collaboratively. Our entire team works remotely, so the ideal candidate will be able to manage their own time and be effective with limited daily oversight. Finally, we are passionate about producing research and datasets that will make a difference in how we manage the world's oceans.Job RequirementsTechnical skills Demonstrated skills with Python or R (with preference for R based on current model implementation) SQL experience Demonstrated abilities to process and interpret large datasets Knowledge of machine learning concepts and basic modeling The Required Team And Communication Skills Team player, willing to work, teach, learn with/to/from the GFW team Proactive mindset – enjoys and exhibits a high-degree of ownership of tasks and projects Comfortable working in a small but fast growing organization Excellent communication skills – in person, phone, and, most important, written Comfortable communicating with a wide range of individuals, including peers, juniors and senior level people, and government officials from multiple countries Intellectually curious, forward thinking, willing to suggest / try new technologies and creative approaches to problems Ability to work in a remote-only distributed team (in more than 5 different time zones) Helpful skills, but can be learned on the job Knowledge about marine science and human impacts on the ocean Location: GFW has a distributed workforce, with employees all over the world. This position will require the successful candidate to work closely with team members based in California and Buenos Aires. Working from Asian or European time zones can be acceptable if the candidate is willing to work outside of normal business hours.Responsible to: Research & Innovation DirectorSalary or Compensation: Commensurate with experience. GFW offers pension/retirement, health and other benefits commensurate with similar level GFW employees in the country of employment.Working Hours: GFW supports flexible working, so the pattern of hours may vary according to operational and personal needs. GFW works across different time zones and weekend work may be required on occasion. Periodic domestic and international travel will be required to meet with team members and for workshops. No overtime is payable.Travel: Currently suspended due to COVID-19.

You love data and nothing gives you a thrill like seeing folks in the company use the tools & data you provide to drive insights we can do something about. But you also love finding insights yourself, and you do so using your mastery of SQL and a bunch of leading 3rd party tools (we happen to use Looker, Heap, dbt, Stitch, Segment, Redshift). Knowledge of Python is preferred. Mostly, you love those euphoric “aha” moments you get when data tells a compelling story and you want everyone to experience them, because it’s awesome. Challenging the status quo of workplace technology is a big problem with almost every type of data challenge, so you should be up for it and love this stuff.We value being a top-notch organization with a strong data and engineering-driven culture, and have the same high standards with our data, code, systems, and people.

Our projects tend to be 1-2 people max, so trust and accountability is required for us to work.You will  Partner closely with anyone and everyone across the company to build dashboards & extract insights.

You are   Someone with extremely high standards that obsesses over data accuracy. You’re practical and know perfect is the enemy of good, but you aspire for us to be great. You care deeply about the quality of your work and our data. You are passionate about finding the insights and “truth” that data can give.   A big picture, systems thinker. You think about how the whole is a sum of many parts and how we can properly measure them end to end such that we have the per context for insights.   An owner. You feel personally accountable and responsible and know seeing the problem is less than half of it. You look for problems and inefficiencies and find elegant solutions to them before they become major issues.   Fast-paced. You love the speed of and impact you have in startups.

You are inspired by what people inside and outside Envoy know and are eager to incorporate the world's knowledge into your work.   Emotionally mature & humble. You care about being effective over being right. Ideally you’ve made major changes & decisions in your life and learned from the results.   Communicative & empathetic. You are happy when helping others succeed, particularly your team and partners across the company.   You have   Strong proficiency with constructing efficient SQL and ideally in Python   Background and experience in data analytics and/or data science, and several years’ working experience in non-trivial data environments. Preferably folks who have at least 3-4+ years’ experience (enough to have been around a number of environments, data sets, and situations to have good breadth and depth)   Experience with algorithms, tools, and techniques for data mining, linear regression, machine learning.   Knowledge of & experience with where the data comes from and how it makes it through the pipeline into a query result or interface. You’ve worked 1st hand (or in close partnership with an engineer) with various data storage technologies, pipelines, ETL, and visualization systems at scale. We use Redshift, Looker, dbt, Stitch, Split.io.   A passion for scale, performance, and quality. You think people deserve access to their data in milliseconds and feel incorrect data is an insult.

At Opendoor, we’re on a mission to make it simple to buy and sell homes. The traditional process is broken, with an average home taking over 90 days to sell and costing thousands of dollars. We empower everyone with the freedom to move by making buying and selling a home stress-free and instant. We’ve built an exceptional team, seen strong growth, served nearly 78,000 customers (with an annual run rate of $5 billion), and raised $1.3 billion in funding. With Covid-19, the world is changing, and real estate is no exception. The coming years present a tremendous opportunity for innovation as we explore new frontiers and scale nationwide.About The TeamIn the past five years, Opendoor has expanded rapidly to 21 cities and buys and sells billions of dollars of homes per year. But, our vision is to empower everyone with the freedom to move, which necessitates making the Opendoor experience more affordable, consistent, and customer friendly in existing markets, while we also expand our coverage into new markets.The Operations Excellence team reports to the President of Homes & Services and is responsible for driving many of Opendoor’s most complex and cross-functional priorities from inception to scale. We use technology and process improvement to refine a very complex operating model that powers “the freedom to move”. Our scope spans the minute a home seller receives an offer from Opendoor, ends with our reselling each home we buy to the next customer, and touches hundreds of processes in between from inspecting each home before we buy it, to renovating homes to we own, to negotiating contract terms with buyers. We make both linear and step change improvements to continue to elevate how we serve customers across all of our existing markets, and expand our core platform and adjacent products (e.g., Buy with Opendoor, Mortgage) to additional markets.Our core team of ~15 professionals supports an org of approximately 700 people.

You’re experienced in designing analyses to prove or disprove hypotheses, and you look to data not only for the “what” (“what’s happening in our business?”) but the “so what” (“why does this matter and what is it telling us about potential next steps?”)A systems thinker: you’re a strategic thinker who can go deep on a business and understand its core drivers; you’re also biased to action and know that the true test of an idea comes when we try it out in the real world.Highly collaborative: You’re excited about working across all of our regions and across all levels of the organization: with our leadership team, our functions, our GMs, and our city operations teams. You’re comfortable not just surfacing data-driven insights but communicating them effectively as well.Customer-first: You care about our customers, and you understand that we exist, first and foremost, to serve a customer need.

By providing access to data, we enable financial institutions to comfortably deploy their capital and make data-driven decisions to drive the growth of their business.

This modeling framework combines multiple land model components; 1) dynamic vegetation with disturbances and plant demography, 2) biogeochemical and climate interactions and 3) representations of human systems, including agriculture and energy sectors. You will incorporate the flow and influence of LULCC within and between each model component.You will work closely with a project called E3SM, the Energy Exascale Earth System Model. The E3SM project is the development of a next-generation Earth system model (ESM). The task for this position is associated with understanding the implications of different energy futures for the biogeochemical cycle through changes in land-use land-cover, water availability, and extreme events.You will work with two types of land-surface ecosystem models, ELM and FATES, and in close connection with the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) which explores the human-Earth system. FATES (Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator) simulates vegetation dynamics and life history strategies with size- and age-structured demography, and represents disturbances and vegetation recovery; however, the representation and impact of land-use change is missing. GCAM is featured in E3SM and allows for the ability to represent the full human-Earth system by using its economic, energy, and land-use components to be coupled with the atmosphere, ocean, and land components of E3SM.The main objective for this position is to investigate implications of land-use scenarios based on different climate policy assumptions, when including LULCC into a dynamic vegetation disturbance model that includes shifts between natural and managed land, as well as biogeochemical changes from ELM. These predictions then are used to guide human decision-making of future energy, water, and land use.What You Will Do Develop modeling capabilities for representing different land-use types within a dynamic vegetation model with plant demography.  Work with different approaches for model interfacing and coupling between three land models (GCAM, ELM, FATES).  Ensure consistency of land use and land cover between GCAM, ELM, and FATES.  Evaluate how ecosystems shifting from natural vegetation to a variety of managed land will impact: carbon stocks, land-subsurface processes, land-atmosphere interactions, and trace gas emissions.  Test hypotheses for predicting carbon cycle, water cycle, and societal feedbacks from varying forest management under climate change in E3SM; resulting in a peer-reviewed publication(s).  Explore implications of simulating different energy futures, comparable to different SSPs, with E3SM-GCAM and FATES; resulting in a peer-reviewed publication(s). What Is Required Ph.D. in ecology, earth sciences, or related field.  Experience in dynamic and demographic modeling, and/or experience in or knowledge of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs).  Knowledge of land-use land-cover change datasets.  Experience using land-surface biogeochemical models and ecosystem model development.  Strong coding and mathematical skills.  Some experience with gridded datasets for Earth scale models.  Ability to collaborate with colleagues and advisors at multiple institutions. While this position is located at LBNL, it will involve close collaboration with researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.  Excellent written and oral presentation skills.  Record of timely publications. The posting shall remain open until the position is filled.Notes This is a full time, 2 year, postdoctoral appointment with the possibility of renewal based upon satisfactory job performance, continuing availability of funds and ongoing operational needs. You must have less than 3 years paid postdoctoral experience. Salary for Postdoctoral positions depends on years of experience post-degree.  Full-time, M-F, exempt (monthly paid) from overtime pay.  This position is represented by a union for collective bargaining purposes.  Salary will be predetermined based on postdoctoral step rates.  This position may be subject to a background check.

Joining Vanta means seeing all parts of the business, helping to build the team, shaping Vanta's culture from the earliest stages, and building core parts of our infrastructure as we grow and scale.No security experience is required, just a passion for our mission of making data safe on the internet.You will: Build on our Typescript/React/Apollo stack, which uses typing extensively to enforce safe coding.

Value ownership, diversity of thought, and empathy for our users and your coworkers. About UsWe started Vanta in 2017 as Equifax had lost every American's social security number, Home Depot had leaked its customers' credit card numbers to hackers, and Facebook admitted that it irresponsibly sent user data to third parties who tried to influence the US election. It was clear that security and privacy had become mainstream issues, and that we all increasingly relied on cloud services to store everything from our personal photos to our communications at work.Vanta's mission is to be the layer of trust on top of these services, and to secure the internet, increase trust in software companies, and keep consumer data safe.We do this by building an automated head of security for technology companies, and we use that system to both help a company secure itself and to prove their security to others.If we succeed in our mission, it should feel irresponsible for users to put data into a product that isn't certified by Vanta, and irresponsible for companies to collect data without using Vanta to secure and monitor themselves.Show moreShow less

We integrate seamlessly into daily workflows, whether you are proactively optimizing performance or investigating a root cause so you can quickly get back to building features. We continue to grow our talented, low-ego, team! We believe that we should always align our actions toward a common purpose, that trust is paramount and must be cultivated, that the most valuable team members multiply rather than add, and that we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously (except when we're writing way-too-long sentences about our values). We believe that assembling and retaining an inclusive and diverse team is the best way to grow a successful company.We created Lightstep because we understand the massive architectural transformation underway in the software industry, and we saw an opportunity to accelerate it, all while improving the quality of the developer and end-user experience. While we learned a great deal from our experiences building Dapper (Google's distributed tracing solution) and Monarch (Google's high-availability metrics solution), Lightstep is in many ways a reaction to and a generational improvement beyond those approaches. Our story as individuals and as a company revolves around continuous learning, careful listening, and the belief that these fundamentally new software architectures require fundamentally new solutions.As a Software Engineer, you'll play a pivotal role in shaping new product offerings and scaling a sophisticated system, while working closely with our other engineers.

You're excited to work on a tool that other developers rely on for their 5 9's and firefighting! Bonus points if… You've developed in, or look forward to, learning Go.

Because staying on track with doctor’s orders requires more than just delivering pills, we’re managing everything from insurance logistics to pricing, late-night questions to supply chain, and anything else that could stand in the way of effective treatment. Our more than 800 employees are dedicated to fulfilling medicine’s true purpose: to improve the quality of life for everyone who needs it. We’ve filled over 1 million prescriptions to date. To aid our calling, we’ve raised $354 million in funding, and we’re on track to achieve $1 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by 2021. Join us as we prove just how much a pharmacy can deliver.We use advanced technology and human empathy to advance a broken pharmacy industry into the modern era, and to make high-quality healthcare accessible to all. As an Alto Engineer, you will have the opportunity to build across the breadth of our products -- from our patient mobile application to our provider web dashboard to internal tools for our home grown pharmacy management system called Wunderbar. Our mission at Alto is to fulfill medicine’s true purpose—to improve quality of life—for everyone who needs it. We are building the best pharmacy for everybody, everywhere.About The RoleYou are a generalist who owns projects from end-to-end, enjoys problem-solving, and values the impact your work makes on our patients. You always put the patient experience first. You are scrappy and resourceful, unafraid to dive into an unknown project but humble enough to make mistakes and iterate. You thrive on speed and wearing many hats, and you enjoy working on different parts of the tech stack (we use Ruby on Rails, React, React Native, and Go).Within your 1st month, you will ship small features to Alto’s products. You’ll familiarize yourself with our tech stack, code review process, and codebase to learn how everything connects together. You’ll also shadow our Pharmacy Operations, Patient Care, and Fulfillment Teams to understand Alto from every perspective, and you’ll even speak to real patients on a support call. By your 2nd month, you will contribute to the planning, scoping, and code of a larger project. By your 3rd month, you’ll possess the confidence and skill set to own and ship a large project or feature. You’ll feel comfortable within our codebase and be able to tackle bugs independently.Accelerate your Career as You work on Projects such as: Fertility Auto-Billing: The process of billing for fertility medication is very complex. To automate the manual work of calculating medication costs for the patients, we began by solving structural problems within our complex systems like understanding which clinics should be eligible for certain coupons and differentiating how much we saved patients vs how much their insurance contributed. Once we solved for these challenges, we automated the billing process with Ruby, React, and Postgres. This simplified an end-to-end billing process from how we receive prescriptions for fertility patients to generating competitive medication quotes for them. React Native Patient App: Building a patient mobile app from scratch in React Native for both iOS and Android, along with the API endpoints to integrate the app with Alto’s backend. This app enables patients to onboard, schedule deliveries, order refills, communicate with their pharmacist, and better understand their medications. Bottoms Up Analytics: To put our patients first, we often analyze how to increase the efficiency of our own internal workflows. One of our projects called Bottoms Up Analytics provides real time tracking metrics on where our Patient Care and Pharmacy Teams are spending their time daily in Wunderbar. We do that by using a Javascript client that reports the activity to our microservices; it is designed for high throughput and receives hundreds of requests/sec. Having this insight allows our engineers to prioritize and implement new projects and features that enable other teams cross-functionally to work more efficiently while providing the best patient care possible. A Bit About You Have 5+ years of experience writing production code Are familiar or excited to learn/code with several programming languages and web frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React, React Native, Go, or Python Thrive in a dynamic fast-paced environment where you own products from start to finish, and make decisions quickly and independently Believe in Alto’s mission and embodies our company values About Our BenefitsWe believe that a happy mind and body make a happy and successful employee, so we're pleased to offer solutions that keep your mind and body refreshed and healthy. Our employees have access to comprehensive medical, dental, and vision care packages, on-demand counseling services with Ginger, on-site meditation and mindfulness classes, and discounted gym memberships.Peace of mind allows our employees to focus on what matters in life!

To help us scale and keep up with our customer and product demands, we're scaling our engineering team in San Francisco.We're looking for software engineers of any experience level who want to take ownership and drive development of large product areas. Joining Vanta means seeing all parts of the business, helping to build the team, shaping Vanta's culture from the earliest stages, and building core parts of our infrastructure as we grow and scale.No security experience is required, just a passion for our mission of making data safe on the internet.You will: Build on our Typescript/React/Apollo stack, which uses typing extensively to enforce safe coding. Work closely with our customers and customer-facing roles. Help define Vanta's engineering culture as we grow. Own major parts of our product and infrastructure. You have: Have a degree in computer science, work experience as a software engineer, or just an aptitude for technology. Be interested in doing more than simply writing code, with a desire to contribute to the business as a whole. Have strong communication skills in addition to your coding ability. Value ownership, diversity of thought, and empathy for our users and your coworkers. About UsWe started Vanta in 2017 as Equifax had lost every American's social security number, Home Depot had leaked its customers' credit card numbers to hackers, and Facebook admitted that it irresponsibly sent user data to third parties who tried to influence the US election. It was clear that security and privacy had become mainstream issues, and that we all increasingly relied on cloud services to store everything from our personal photos to our communications at work.Vanta's mission is to be the layer of trust on top of these services, and to secure the internet, increase trust in software companies, and keep consumer data safe.We do this by building an automated head of security for technology companies, and we use that system to both help a company secure itself and to prove their security to others.If we succeed in our mission, it should feel irresponsible for users to put data into a product that isn't certified by Vanta, and irresponsible for companies to collect data without using Vanta to secure and monitor themselves.Show moreShow less

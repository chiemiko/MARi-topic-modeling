Big Ladder Software seeks to hire an experienced EnergyPlus modeler/programmer to help us develop the next wave of innovative building energy modeling software tools. 
 
About Us 
 
Founded in 2009, Big Ladder Software is a Denver-based company dedicated to providing software and services for the building energy modeling industry. The company name reflects our mission to “help our clients reach new heights”. We are a team of mechanical engineers and programmers with a unique combination of expertise in building science, computer-based simulation, and software development. We are part of the development teams for the state-of-the-art EnergyPlus simulation engine and the California Simulation Engine. We also develop and maintain several of our own open-source software tools for building energy modeling. We provide training workshops, commercial support, and consulting services to mechanical, architectural, and design engineering firms across the US. Over the past several years, the company has experienced steady growth and achieved significant success and recognition in the industry. 
 
About You 
 
You are a hybrid--part energy modeler, part programmer. Perhaps you got your start at a mechanical or architectural engineering firm, or maybe a software startup or national lab. Whatever path led you to energy modeling, you discovered that the software developers had the best tools and techniques to make your work easier. Even though you may not have heard it before, the mantra “model like a programmer” sounds like your perfect jam. Today you find yourself pushing the limits of your energy modeling tools on a daily basis, and it frustrates you to no end. You think there MUST be better ways to do software for building energy modeling. What if you could put your hybrid superpowers to good use and help elevate the next generation of energy modeling tools for everyone? What if you could enjoy the challenge of interesting, creative work, while also having a meaningful impact on the planet? What if you could play a major role in a small, but growing, dynamic team of mechanical engineers, scientists, and programmers? Sound like you?

BACKGROUND  
On January 1, 2018, the Economics, Finance and Institutions (EFI) Vice Presidency created the Macroeconomics, Trade and Investment (MTI) Global Practice. The MTI Global Practice is responsible for delivering analytic, advisory, financial and convening services in the areas of fiscal management, macroeconomics, growth, trade policy, regional integration, business regulation, and investment climate.  These services support various lines of work with our clients including: (i) the design and implementation of macro-fiscal frameworks that are aligned with the goals of reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, and grounded in economic, social and environmental sustainability; (ii) the design and implementation of sustainable fiscal and debt policy, including on the effectiveness, efficiency, level and composition of government spending; (iii) growth analytics and policies to start, sustain and boost growth; and (iv) the analysis of the impact of external shocks and developments on growth and the government fiscal position, including, for example, terms of trade, global crisis and longer term issues such as population ageing. In addition, the MTI Global Practice is an important contributor to the integration of policies for growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity.  
  
Trade is an engine of growth that creates jobs, reduces poverty and increases economic opportunity. Regional integration helps countries overcome divisions that impede the flow of goods, services, capital, people and ideas. The World Bank Group helps its client countries improve their access to developed country markets and enhance their participation in the world economy and promote regional integration through common physical and institutional infrastructure. The Global Trade and Regional Integration Unit (GMTRI) performs analytical work to inform the design of policies and institutions, provides technical assistance and advisory services to strengthen governments’ capacity to reap the gains from trade and integration, finances investment in infrastructure and institutions for regional integration, and catalyzes domestic and international dialogue.

The type of trade policies for investigation include distributional impacts as well as the localized labor market effects of new FTAs such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Africa Continental Free-Trade Agreement, as well as the analysis of linkages between trade, sector of employment, gender and poverty feeding among others to the Trade and Gender report. Experience with programming in GAMS is required, while STATA is considered a strong asset.

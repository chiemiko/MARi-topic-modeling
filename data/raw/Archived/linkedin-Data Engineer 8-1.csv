DomainTools is seeking a Senior Software Engineer to work in a position dedicated to integration of our data and systems into other security products. As our Senior Integration Engineer, you’ll build and extend a suite of software projects ranging from integration apps built in specific frameworks to plugins and pull requests for open source projects. You’ll dive in, learn how the third-party product works, master it’s app dev framework, and then add new capabilities built on DomainTools’ amazing DNS and domain profile data. You’ll also have opportunities to contribute code to our core products as we work to integrate them directly with the security products our customers already use to defend their networks. We’re always busy creating relationships with big security software vendors and emerging security product companies, and that means more integration apps and plugins for you to build and APIs to talk to.

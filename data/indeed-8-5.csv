 <h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Company Overview
At Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK), we’re not only changing the way we treat cancer, but also the way the world thinks about it. By working together and pushing forward with innovation and discovery, we’re driving excellence and improving outcomes.<br/>
<br/>
For the 28th year, MSK has been named a top hospital for cancer by U.S. News &amp; World Report. We are proud to be on Becker’s Healthcare list as one of the 150 Great Places to Work in Healthcare in 2018, as well as one of Glassdoor’s Employees’ Choice Best Place to Work for 2018. We’re treating cancer, one patient at a time. Join us and make a difference every day.<br/>

<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Job Description
WHEN APPLYING: Please include (as a single PDF) both a resume and a cover letter; in the letter, we’d love to hear about the most impactful project you’ve worked on recently.<br/>

Strategy Analytics and Patient Access
The Strategy Analytics team (within the Department of Strategy &amp; Innovation) leverages data to shape strategic decisions at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and solve problems that measurably impact the lives of our patients and staff. We were awarded the 2012 INFORMS Prize for “repeatedly applying the principles of advanced analytics and operations research / management science in pioneering, varied, novel, and lasting ways.” We encourage analysts’ technical and business skill development in a variety of ways, including conferences and external workshops, internal training and journal clubs, creating analytical tools and best practices, and developing our own in-house R package.<br/>

This position is part of the Embedded Analytics Program and has dual reporting to (1) the Senior Director of Patient Access for goal setting and project implementation and (2) the Analytics Manager for technical supervision and mentorship. Embedded Analytics allows our analysts to be a full member of an operational team to truly understand their needs and ensure sustainable implementation of work, while still being part of a diverse and energizing community of analytics experts.<br/>
The Patient Access Service (PAS) is the front-door for the majority of Memorial Sloan Kettering’s patients. A team of 70+ Care Advisors and nurses is charged with helping patients access MSK clinicians by collecting information about their medical history and treatments, identifying the right sub-specialist to provide expert care, and coordinating appointment logistics.<br/>

The Role and Projects
We are seeking a Senior Strategic Consultant / Data Scientist who will serve as the lead on projects crucial to ensuring MSK’s growth and allowing patients continued access to our clinicians’ expertise. This will involve defining and scoping analyses, collecting and managing data, performing statistical and mathematical modeling, developing new tools and systems, and disseminating actionable insights. This will be as part of a team of two, in partnership with the current Data Scientist embedded with the Patient Access Service.<br/>

You will:
Serve as an analytical thought partner to Patient Access leadership, especially the Senior Director, Clinical Director, and 8 front-line managers
Become deeply versed in the operational needs of Patient Access and own the strategic roadmap for iteratively developing analytical products in support of those needs
Manage individual analytical products and projects (both independently and in collaboration with the current Data Scientist) from ""question to answer"" including problem framing, data collection and validation, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, visualization, synthesis, and ongoing maintenance of reusable tools
Effectively communicate actionable insights and see them through to implementation<br/>

Sample projects include:
Growth Planning and Strategy: PAS leadership collaborates closely with clinicians and administrators on how to grow and manage their services. How can we provide them additional data and insights to guide clinician recruitment and practice management?
Call Center Operations: Patient demand is variable and changing. How can we define optimal staffing and training policies so as to maximize service levels while maintaining staff satisfaction?
Patient Experience: How can we collect timely and relevant data about patients’ experience of becoming an MSK patient while being respectful of their time and emotional state? How can we surface insights from this data to improve PAS operations?<br/>

Qualifications
We are looking for an analytics professional who has both deep technical skills and a passion for applying them to real-world problems in partnership with non-technical stakeholders. Our successful analysts typically have the below qualifications:<br/>

You have a proven track record (4-7 years of experience) of using analytics and data science to impact key business decisions
You’re a strong consultant skilled at partnering with non-technical stakeholders to turn vague business problems into crisp analytical projects
You know how to choose the right technical approach for a question (from a statistical model to a dashboard and everything in between) and know that the simplest solution is often the best
You’re a storyteller, able to synthesize knowledge from a variety of sources and clearly communicate complex topics to non-technical audiences<br/>

You’ve conducted reproducible analyses using R, Python, or a similar language
You’ve built beautiful production-grade dashboards using Tableau or a similar BI tool
You’re deeply comfortable with relational databases and SQL
You have a solid understanding of common statistical methods (especially regression models and probability)<br/>

You’re curious and self-motivated, and you thrive when working autonomously. You know when to run with something and when to ask for help.
You have a bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g. statistics, economics, operations research, mathematics) or equivalent training, fellowship, or work experience<br/>

Nice-to-have qualifications (but definitely not requirements) would include a master’s degree and prior experience in healthcare or call center operations.<br/>

NT Concepts,United States,"Data Scientist (Ft. Worth, TX) ",30+,," 
 <h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Overview
Who We Are
We’re NT Concepts, a leading provider of business and technology solutions for the intelligence and national security communities! Our team of engineers, subject matter experts, and data scientists provide experienced, high-quality Information Technology (IT) and cybersecurity engineering and innovation support. We do that by working with some complex clients on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and keeping our skills sharp. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like so hang out with. That's important.<br/>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Responsibilities
And… Why We’re Both Here - This “Job” Thing
Here it is: we have some opportunities. And we’d like to get to know some more amazing people, that might want to talk about that. People like you. Since you’re reading this, and the title’s “data scientist,” we’re thinking you might be a little interested. Very cool.<br/>

We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. We've got some tricky time-series data on this particular project and are looking for creative minds in the deep learning space to tackle it. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Qualifications
Who You Are
Okay, beyond the basics (you solve problems, and are generally nice), we’re looking for a few skills. Less concerned with the specific technologies (great scientists can learn new tech as it emerges), more about horsepower.. That said, here are a couple bullets, things we look for:<br/>

Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data (time-series a plus!).
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
You've got experience with deep learning.
Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.
Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time-series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics.
We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem sets<br/>

Required:
Secret clearance required, higher is a plus

Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD): A core research area for IHME is the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD). A systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time, the GBD is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. The GBD’s aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health.
<br/>
<br/>
Local Burden of Disease: IHME is seeking to revolutionize the way we track diseases around the world by developing innovative geospatial analytic methods to produce increasingly granular estimates of diseases and determinants. Just a few of the diseases this revolutionary work will touch on are pneumonia and its etiologies, diarrhea and its pathogens, malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, Ebola, as well as select neglected tropical diseases. Through the development and use of geospatial techniques to synthesize information at the local level, and in partnership with key collaborators around the world, IHME will present results in interactive high-resolution maps to illuminate levels, trends, and disparities in health outcomes.
<br/>
Central Computation: At the core of both the GBD and Geospatial Analysis is the need to take innovative analytic methods and devise ways to carry them out more easily and routinely. By creating and applying novel coding and computational solutions, the Data Analyst helps resolve thorny challenges to enable the timely and efficient production of high-caliber scientific and policy-relevant results. The solutions developed must allow databases, analytic engines, and creative data visualizations to function seamlessly with one another.
<br/>
<br/>
Resource Tracking: The Financial Resources for Health (FRH) research team is a longstanding core research team at IHME whose focus is to systematically, scientifically track resources spent on health and measure their impact. This research covers both domestic and international financing and uses a wide variety of data and statistical processes. To create health spending and impact estimates, this position collects, cleans, and manages a diverse set of quantitative data including household surveys, global databases, censuses, literature, and administrative records. Relevant data include a range of topics: health financing, epidemiology, demography, health systems, and health outcome determinants and risk factors such as education, income, and air pollution.
<br/>
<br/>
Forecasting and Cost Effectiveness: This research area is to help policymakers, donors, ministries of health and public health workers to effectively apply and scale up interventions by empowering them to review and compare the relative costs, efficacy, and impact of potential interventions and the modulation of different factors to the health system. By empowering these stakeholders with the best possible understanding of both what the future might look like based upon current assumptions and allowing them to compare different scenarios over time we equip them to better understand the tradeoffs inherent in different resource allocation decisions today and into the future.
<br/>
<br/>
Primary Data Collection: IHME aims to provide the best possible quantitative evidence base to policymakers, donors, and researchers in order to make decisions that lead to better health. Often that means providing as complete a picture as possible of health in a particular country, drawing upon a wide array of secondary data sources and helping prepare and execute primary data collection processes and systems. The Data Analyst will be integral to creating instruments for data collection, corresponding with field teams, and contributing to data management, data verification, and the creation of graphics and tables for analysis. This position will help with data quality management through an intensive period of data collection and will be instrumental in helping to present the key summary results derived from the data.

After all, it’s our people that enable us to offer the level of service that we do. And we invest in them accordingly, offering exceptional benefits like:

Advantage Technologies,"Marietta, GA 30068",Network Engineer ,23,"$30,000 - $40,000 a year"," 
 Position Outline: A Network Engineer is the front lines for providing onsite computer network installation, management, and support to our client base. You will be installing servers, workstations, cabling, mounts, backup systems, digital imaging software packages, and the other items necessary for our clients to effectively utilize technology in their business. You will also be responsible for providing field and remote support as needed, working in cooperation with our operations center. You don’t report to an office each day, you work from home for support and go directly to client sites for onsite service. If you enjoy working in different offices and changes in scenery, this is a great opportunity.

 About the Company: Advantage Technologies (www.adv-tech.com) is pretty much one of the coolest places to work in the world. We treat our people like partners, and everyone pulls together to build our team. No gossip, no backstabbing. We really care about our people, and it shows. Advantage Technologies provides computer hardware, software, security, and networking infrastructure to small business, particularly focusing on professional service organizations (dentists, doctors, engineering companies, insurance agencies, CPA firms, etc). We provide the servers, workstations, cabling, management and integration services to keep our clients serving their clients. We deliver Hassle Free IT.

 1. Customer Technical Support – providing remote and onsite support to our existing client base in cooperation with the operations and support center. Assist our operations center with coordinating who on your team to send where as needed.<br/>
2. Project implementation – once a customer purchases a system, you need to manage the implementation of the project. You need to be technically comfortable with managing server installations, workstation deployments, installation of software and network systems. Additionally, you need to be mechanically inclined. We hang mounts, TV’s, run cabling, install xray machines, and a variety of other mechanical tasks that aren’t considered “classic IT”. If you’re looking to sit in a server room and push buttons, this isn’t for you. If you’re looking to integrate IT into a business and make it look awesome – you could be a fit.<br/>
3. Assisting the sales team – Everyone on our team helps the sales team by being “on the lookout” for new sales opportunities. Maybe you’re in an office that has hardware that should be refreshed. Maybe you’re onsite at an office that is currently not managed. These are opportunities to make the sales rep in the area aware of, so that they can pursue these clients.<br/>
4. Be accountable with your time – all time and activities should be clearly logged in our CRM system.

Desired Skills and Experience:
 Understanding of Windows based networks including servers, workstations, and core networking concepts Understanding of routers, switches, firewalls, and other basic networking equipment, specifically related to installation and troubleshooting. Understanding of printers, scanners, and other standard IT peripherals, specifically related to installation and troubleshooting.

 Advancement Opportunity: The Network Engineer is great opening opportunity in the engineering team. The next position would be a Senior Engineer. As the customer base grows, we make it a policy to promote from within, given that individuals have demonstrated the ability to handle that level of leadership.

 Employee Supplied Items: You will be responsible for supplying the following:
 Portable computer running Windows 7 or newer, with an i5 or faster processor, 8gb of RAM with a docking solution that allows for dual monitors when working from home, and sufficient battery lift for working at client offices.
 Android, iPhone, or Windows phone with adequate voice and data allowances. High speed internet connection at your home office. A quiet, distraction free home office.

Our Data Engineer position is unique.

Who We Are
We’re NT Concepts, a leading provider of business and technology solutions for the intelligence and national security communities! Our team of engineers, subject matter experts, and data scientists provide experienced, high-quality Information Technology (IT) and cybersecurity engineering and innovation support. We do that by working with some complex clients on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and keeping our skills sharp. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like so hang out with. That's important.<br/>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Responsibilities
And… Why We’re Both Here - This “Job” Thing
Here it is: we have some opportunities. And we’d like to get to know some more amazing people, that might want to talk about that. People like you. Since you’re reading this, and the title’s “data scientist,” we’re thinking you might be a little interested. Very cool.<br/>

We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. We've got some tricky time-series data on this particular project and are looking for creative minds in the deep learning space to tackle it. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Qualifications
Who You Are
Okay, beyond the basics (you solve problems, and are generally nice), we’re looking for a few skills. Less concerned with the specific technologies (great scientists can learn new tech as it emerges), more about horsepower.. That said, here are a couple bullets, things we look for:<br/>

Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data (time-series a plus!).
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
You've got experience with deep learning.
Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.
Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time-series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics.
We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem sets<br/>

Required:
Secret clearance required, higher is a plus

 NSA Overview
The professionals at the National Security Agency (NSA) have one common goal: to protect our nation. The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information.
At NSA, mathematics and statistics are core disciplines and are present in every aspect of the mission.
Mathematical Statisticians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, regression, machine learning, exploratory data analysis, stochastic processes, and statistical modeling and forecasting. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and cybersecurity (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information).
Mathematical Statisticians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country.
Description of Position
NSA is actively seeking mathematical statisticians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals.
Newly-hired mathematical statisticians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematical statisticians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability.
The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Statistics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, statisticians work in:
- Signals analysis
- Data compression
- Machine learning
- Data science
- Human language technology
- Speech/image/video processing
- Analysis of communication networks
- Network vulnerability analysis
- Cybersecurity
Additionally, computing is an essential component of the mathematical sciences at NSA and statisticians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematical statistician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.
Skills
Candidates should possess:
- Strong problem-solving and analytical abilities
- Desire for continual learning
- Ability to work effectively independently and within teams across functional areas
Knowledge and experience in one or more of the following is desired, but not required:
- Programming expertise
- Experience in the design, development, use, and evaluation of mathematics models, methods, and/or techniques (e.g., algorithm development) to study issues and solve problems
Pay, Benefits, &amp; Work Schedule
This is a full-time position, Monday through Friday.
Position Summary
NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals to collaborate in both long and short term work to solve mission-critical problems. To solve the problems generated by NSA's mission, mathematicians draw from a wide body of mathematical knowledge, including number theory, abstract algebra, graph theory, combinatorics, analysis, probability, statistics and more. However, the essential ingredient to the solution of a problem is often not mathematical knowledge per se, but the keen analytic ability that a mathematician possesses through training and talent.

 NSA Overview
The professionals at the National Security Agency (NSA) have one common goal: to protect our nation. The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information.
At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission.
Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information).
Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country.
Description of Position
NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals.
Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability.
The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in:
- Signals analysis
- Data compression
- Machine learning
- Data science
- Human language technology
- Speech/image/video processing
- Analysis of communication networks
- Network vulnerability analysis
- Cybersecurity
Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.
Skills
Candidates should possess:
- Strong problem-solving and analytical abilities
- Desire for continual learning
- Ability to work effectively independently and within teams across functional areas
Knowledge and experience in one or more of the following is desired, but not required:
- Programming expertise
- Experience in the design, development, use, and evaluation of mathematics models, methods, and/or techniques (e.g., algorithm development) to study issues and solve problems
Pay, Benefits, &amp; Work Schedule
This is a full-time position, Monday through Friday.
Position Summary
NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals to collaborate in both long and short term work to solve mission-critical problems. To solve the problems generated by NSA's mission, mathematicians draw from a wide body of mathematical knowledge, including number theory, abstract algebra, graph theory, combinatorics, analysis, probability, statistics and more. However, the essential ingredient to the solution of a problem is often not mathematical knowledge per se, but the keen analytic ability that a mathematician possesses through training and talent.

The Brookings Institution is a nonprofit public policy organization based in Washington, DC. Our mission is to conduct in-depth research that leads to new ideas for solving problems facing society at the local, national and global level.<br/>
We bring together leading experts in government and academia from all over the world, rooted in open-minded inquiry and representing diverse points of view, who provide the highest quality research, policy recommendations, and analysis. Research topics cover a full range of public policy issues in economics, foreign policy, development, governance and metropolitan policy.<br/>

With fair and transparent business practices, clear communication, mutual respect, and a collaborative atmosphere that offers both professional and personal development opportunities, Brookings offers an inclusive and welcoming workplace that values the efforts of all contributors.<br/>

The Foreign Policy program at Brookings is a leading center of policy-relevant scholarship exploring the rapidly re-ordering geopolitics of the great and major powers, and the disordering relations among states and transnational actors in the greater Middle East. Our scholars provide concrete policy recommendations for how U.S. strategy, the international security architecture, and key allies should adapt to changing threats and opportunities.<br/>

This position and the project it supports are part of the new Global Democracy and Emerging Tech Initiative at Brookings. The Research Analyst works closely with the project directors to conduct in-depth research and manage the implementation of a new project in the Foreign Policy program’s Center on the United States and Europe (CUSE). The core objective of the project is to better prepare for and anticipate future tech-driven threats from state and non-state actors, including but not limited to Russia. The project seeks to inform the policy debate on the implications of emerging technology, close information gaps between the tech and policy communities, generate greater common understanding about artificial intelligence (AI)-driven tools and the threats they pose, and develop an early warning monitoring channel to translate the implications of emerging tech for policy.<br/>

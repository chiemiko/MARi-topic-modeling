We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join the Cylance Data Science team. At Cylance, we develop state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to solve long-standing problems in computer security. We discover novel ML techniques and applications, build systems to handle petabytes of ludicrously high dimensional data, and protect people from bad guys.
<br/>
<br/>
With machine learning at the heart of all of Cylance’s products, the Data Science team is a critical, highly visible, and high-impact team within the company. The team brings together experts from machine learning, stats, computer science, computer security, and various applied sciences, with backgrounds including deep learning, Bayesian statistics, time-series modeling, topology, scalable data processing, and software engineering.

Stay abreast of the latest publications and state-of-the-art techniques in relevant research communities (e.g., ML and stats).
Consult with other teams within Cylance on applications of data science.
Collaborate with other data scientists on the team to help accomplish all of the above.
WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR
Extensive knowledge of machine learning fundamentals. You don’t just blindly call fit() in sklearn; you have a deep understanding of how many common ML algorithms work and are able to explain why they work the way they do.
Strong math skills in general, especially linear algebra and statistics.
Intermediate experience with python, at least to the point that you’re able to implement common machine learning algorithms without much trouble.
A Master’s degree or PhD in a relevant area can be substituted for equivalent years of experience.
TECHNOLOGIES WE USE
Python, and libraries like sklearn, numpy, scipy, pytorch, and tensorflow.
Various other languages, including Scala, C/C++, C#, Java, and x86 assembly.

Who You Are
Okay, beyond the basics (you solve problems, and are generally nice), we’re looking for a few skills. Less concerned with the specific technologies (great scientists can learn new tech as it emerges), more about horsepower.. That said, here are a couple bullets, things we look for:<br/>

Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data (time-series a plus!).
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
You've got experience with deep learning.
Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.
Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time-series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics.
We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem sets<br/>

Why Fisher Investments:
Fisher Investments is a different kind of investment firm. We don’t come from Wall Street, nor do we believe we fit in with most of the finance industry, and we’re proud of that. We work for a bigger purpose: bettering the investment universe. From unmatched service to innovative perspectives on investing, it’s the people that make the Fisher purpose possible. After all, it’s our people that enable us to offer the level of service that we do. And we invest in them accordingly, offering exceptional benefits like:
100% coverage of premiums for health, vision and dental insurance
A 50% 401(k) match, up to the IRS maximum
20 days of PTO*, plus 9 paid holidays
8 week paid Primary Caregiver Parental Leave
And much, much more

Research happens across Google everyday, in many different teams. Our research has already impacted user-facing services across Google including Search, Maps and Google Now, and is central to the success of Google Cloud and our planet-scale computing, storage, and networking infrastructure.

We do research differently here. Research Interns aren't cloistered in the lab, but instead they work closely with Software Engineers to discover, invent, and build at the largest scale. Ideas may come from internal projects as well as from collaborations with research programs at partner universities and technical institutes all over the world. From creating experiments and prototyping implementations to designing new architectures, Research Interns and Software Engineers work on challenges in artificial intelligence, machine perception, data mining, machine learning, natural language understanding, privacy, computer architecture, networking, operating systems, storage and data management, and much more. You might also stay connected to your research roots as a contributor to the wider research community by publishing papers.

There is always more information out there, and our research teams have a quest to find new ways to make it accessible and useful. We're constantly refining our signature search engine to provide better results, expanding the scope and utility of our data-analytics systems, enhancing our Cloud applications and infrastructure, among a broad range of other Google products.
Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology's greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">

<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">About the job
Research happens across Google everyday, in many different teams. Our research has already impacted user-facing services across Google including Search, Maps and Google Now, and is central to the success of Google Cloud and our planet-scale computing, storage, and networking infrastructure.

We do research differently here. Research Interns aren't cloistered in the lab, but instead they work closely with Software Engineers to discover, invent, and build at the largest scale. Ideas may come from internal projects as well as from collaborations with research programs at partner universities and technical institutes all over the world. From creating experiments and prototyping implementations to designing new architectures, Research Interns and Software Engineers work on challenges in artificial intelligence, machine perception, data mining, machine learning, natural language understanding, privacy, computer architecture, networking, operating systems, storage and data management, and much more. You might also stay connected to your research roots as a contributor to the wider research community by publishing papers.

There is always more information out there, and our research teams have a quest to find new ways to make it accessible and useful. We're constantly refining our signature search engine to provide better results, expanding the scope and utility of our data-analytics systems, enhancing our Cloud applications and infrastructure, among a broad range of other Google products.
Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology's greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world.

NT Concepts,United States,"Data Scientist (Ft. Worth, TX) ",30+,," 
 <h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Overview
Who We Are
We’re NT Concepts, a leading provider of business and technology solutions for the intelligence and national security communities! Our team of engineers, subject matter experts, and data scientists provide experienced, high-quality Information Technology (IT) and cybersecurity engineering and innovation support. We do that by working with some complex clients on their hardest challenges. Clients with massive, complex data sets. So we get to keep learning, building, and keeping our skills sharp. And since life’s too short to spend with difficult people, we hire team members that not only like to solve problems, but that we like so hang out with. That's important.<br/>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Responsibilities
And… Why We’re Both Here - This “Job” Thing
Here it is: we have some opportunities. And we’d like to get to know some more amazing people, that might want to talk about that. People like you. Since you’re reading this, and the title’s “data scientist,” we’re thinking you might be a little interested. Very cool.<br/>

We love people who dream big, find data fascinating, and understand that’s it’s not just about data: it’s about the science behind it, and how you can use it to solve real-world problems. We've got some tricky time-series data on this particular project and are looking for creative minds in the deep learning space to tackle it. (Also, if you happen to have some level of talent at, say kick-ball or giant Jenga: bonus points).
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Qualifications
Who You Are
Okay, beyond the basics (you solve problems, and are generally nice), we’re looking for a few skills. Less concerned with the specific technologies (great scientists can learn new tech as it emerges), more about horsepower.. That said, here are a couple bullets, things we look for:<br/>

Data science is a dynamic and evolving profession – we’re looking for people who love to learn and find unique solutions without being micro-managed: you’ll have the freedom to try new things, test solutions and technologies, and tell us when there’s a better path.
You know your way around a cloud console and have handled some pretty large volumes of data (time-series a plus!).
You are familiar with a few machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
You've got experience with deep learning.
Maybe you have used enterprise products in the past for high throughput data ingestion and analysis.
Ultimately, we need someone who knows their way around data modeling, information extraction, time-series forecasting, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, or applied mathematics.
We realize that data scientists are a diverse breed and we are excited to hear how your unique combination of skills might apply to our current problem sets<br/>

Required:
Secret clearance required, higher is a plus
Bachelor's degree in a technical field<br/>
